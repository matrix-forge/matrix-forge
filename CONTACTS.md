**MatrixForge** is a library for building and training neural networks written in Python. This library allows you to create and train neural networks in a simple and intuitive way, using built-in tools. The MatrixForge library was created to provide an easy and convenient way to build and train neural networks.

## Library content
MatrixForge consists of the following modules:

- createLayer - a class that allows you to create layers of neural networks, where the user can define the number of nodes in a layer and the activation function for this layer.

- ***forwardPropagation*** - a class that performs forward propagation for a neural network model.

- ***backPropagation*** - a class that implements backpropagation for the neural network model.

- ***modelTrain*** - a class that allows you to train a neural network model.

- ***modelArchitecture*** - a class that allows you to display the architecture of the created neural network model.
