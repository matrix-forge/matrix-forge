## Documentation
MatrixForge consists of the following modules:

- ***createLayer*** - a class that allows you to create layers of neural networks, where the user can define the number of nodes in a layer and the activation function for this layer.

- ***createModel*** - a class representing a neural network model, consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer.

- ***forwardPropagation*** - a class that performs forward propagation for a neural network model.

- ***backPropagation*** - a class that implements backpropagation for the neural network model.

- ***modelTrain*** - a class that allows you to train a neural network model.

- ***model_visualize*** - a class that allows you to display the architecture of the created neural network model.
