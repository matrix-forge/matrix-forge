# MatrixForge - Logo Guidelines

These guidelines are meant to help keep the MatrixForge logo consistent and recognizable across all its uses. They also provide a common language for referring to the logos and their components.

## Design
The MF logo consists of two letters, "M" and "F", which are connected together in a stylized way.

## Color
The primary color of the MF logo is red (#e60000). The logo should be presented in this color whenever possible. If a monochrome option is necessary, it should be presented in black (#000000).

Minimum Size
Please do not make the logo smaller than 50px wide.

Logo Integrity
A few other notes to keep in mind when using the logo:

Do not stretch or distort the logo in any way.
Maintain a good amount of space around the logo. Donâ€™t let it overlap with text, images, or other elements.
Do not modify or alter the logo in any way, including changing its color or adding any effects.
The logo should always be presented in a legible and clear manner.
By following these guidelines, you can help ensure the MF logo is consistently represented and easily recognizable across all its uses.
