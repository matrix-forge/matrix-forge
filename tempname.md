# MatrixForge - Logo Guidelines

These guidelines are meant to help keep the MatrixForge logo consistent and recognizable across all its uses. They also provide a common language for referring to the logos and their components.

## Color
The primary color of the MF logo is red (#ff0000), but it is not forbidden to use other colors. If a monochrome theme is needed, it should be presented in white (#ffffff) with a black background(#000000) 

## Logo Integrity
A few other notes to keep in mind when using the logo:

Do not stretch the logo disproportionately.

Maintain a good amount of space around the logo. Donâ€™t let it overlap with text, images, or other elements.

Do not modify or alter the logo in any way, including changing its color or adding any effects.

The logo should always be presented in a legible and clear manner.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure the MatrixForge logo is consistently represented and easily recognizable across all its uses.
