#MatrixForge is a framework for building neural networks in Python that offers a flexible and efficient implementation of matrix operations using the NumPy library. It allows users to build and train different types of neural networks, including fully connected, convolutional, and recursive networks, and enables various activation features and optimizers.

One of the main assumptions of the MatrixForge framework is to simplify the process of creating and training neural networks by providing an easy-to-understand and intuitive syntax that allows users to build neural networks quickly and efficiently.

MatrixForge also provides a range of tools for analysis and visualization of results, including tools for displaying loss and accuracy functions and tools for visualizing the structure of the neural network.
