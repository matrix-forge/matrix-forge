## Coding style:
- Use PEP8 as a coding style

2. Create a branch with a name that describes the changes you're making. For example, if you are adding new functionality, name branch 'new-feature'.
3. Make your changes to the branch.
4. Write unit tests to make sure your changes are correct.
5. Make sure all tests pass.
6. Make a commit of your changes with a description of what exactly you are changing.
7. Send a pull request to the main branch.
8. Expect team members to review your code.
